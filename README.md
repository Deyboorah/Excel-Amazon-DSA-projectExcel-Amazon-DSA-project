This contains a detailed step-by-step analysis using excel, a project organized by Digital Skill-Up Africa.  Throughout the three-month program, I have learnt a lot on the use of Microsoft Excel to perform various analytical and visualization operations on datasets. I also learnt about portfolio building to showcase the project worked upon.
